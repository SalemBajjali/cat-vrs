  GenomicKnowledgeRule:
    description: The abstract *Genomic Knowledge Rule* parent class. All attributes
      of this parent class are inherited by Genomic Knowledge Rule descendent classes.
      Genomic Knowledge Rules are a mechanism for specifying constraints on how observed
      variation matches to genomic knowledge.
    oneOf:
    - $ref: '#/$defs/SimpleRule'
    - $ref: '#/$defs/ComplexRule'
  SimpleRule:
    description: The SimpleRule abstract class represents the set of GenomicKnowledgeRule
      classes that are used directly by genomic knowledge statements, or as components
      for defining a ComplexRule.

    - $ref: '#/$defs/MolecularConsequenceLocationRule'
    - $ref: '#/$defs/CanonicalVariationRule'
    - $ref: '#/$defs/ConsequenceFeatureRule'
  ComplexRule:
    description: The ComplexRule class constructs objects for defining complex logical
      relationships between two or more other GenomicKnowledgeRule objects.
    properties:

        description: A GA4GH computed identifier.

        type: string
        description: MUST be "ComplexRule".
        enum:
        - ComplexRule
      complement: &id002
        type: bool
        description: This field indicates whether the genomic knowledge rule is defined
          to include (false) or exclude (true) variation concepts matching the rule.
          This is equivalent to a logical NOT operation on the genomic knowledge rule
          expression.

        type: array
        items:
          $ref: '#/$defs/GenomicKnowledgeRule'

        description: The :ref:`GenomicKnowledgeRule` objects that are being evaluated
          collectively.
      operator:
        type: string
        enum:
        - AND
        - OR
        description: The logical operation applied to evaluating the object *operands*.

  MolecularConsequenceLocationRule:
    description: The MolecularConsequenceLocationRule class constructs objects which
      describe any variation that results in the *molecular_consequence* at the specified
      *location*.

      molecular_consequence:
        description: A sequence ontology term specifying the type of molecular consequence.
          The value SHOULD be a descendent term of `SO:0001537 (structural_variant)
          <http://www.sequenceontology.org/browser/current_release/term/SO:0001537>`_.

  CanonicalVariationRule:
    description: The CanonicalVariationRule class constructs objects which describe
      any variation that are congruent with the indicated *variation* value. The rules
      by which congruency is determined are managed at the implementation level, but
      typically involve operations such as variation projection (genomic <-> transcript),
      translation (transcript <-> protein) and liftover (e.g. GRCh37 genomic <-> GRCh38
      genomic).

        description: The `VRS Variation <https://vrs.ga4gh.org/en/1.2.0/terms_and_model.html#variation>`_
          object to which equivalency must be determined.

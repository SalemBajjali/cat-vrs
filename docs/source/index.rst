GA4GH VRSATILE
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**VRS Added Types for Interoperable Loquacious Exchange (VRSATILE;
prounounced "versatile")** is a set of proposed extensions for |vrs| to
enable interoperable exchange of common descriptive data alongside
variation concepts. Common examples of this are reference sequence ids,
`HGVS`_ descriptors, associated concept ids, and community aliases such
as *EGFR vIII*.

VRSATILE also enables simplification of "aggregate" variation concepts
that include multiple contextual forms. Examples of aggregate variation
include the concepts represented by `ClinVar`_ variation IDs, `CIViC`_
variation IDs, `ClinGen Allele Registry`_ Canonical Allele IDs, and `dbSNP`_
Reference SNP IDs.
